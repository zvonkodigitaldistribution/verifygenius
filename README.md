### [Live Link](https://ingenious-app.herokuapp.com/)

[Ingenious](https://ingenious-app.herokuapp.com/) is a [Genius.com](https://genius.com/) clone project, featuring code-related song lyrics and programming music knowledge.

All users can openly browse a curated selection of songs and their lyrics and view annotated notes and interpretations of the tracks' lyrics. _Signed-in_ users can create, update, and delete their own lyric annotations, leave or delete their own comments on the tracks, and upvote or downvote annotations and comments.

While logged in, click and drag to highlight and select lyrics that you'd like to annotate. Type your submission in the form that opens up, and submit to publicly save it to the track's lyrics.

</div>

* Annotations are revealed and hidden on click.

```JavaScript
        for (let i = 0; i < annotationsArr.length; i++) {
            const annotation = annotationsArr[i];
            if (lyrics === undefined) {
                return <div></div>
            }
            let unannotatedSlicedLyric = lyrics.slice(prevIdx, annotation.start_idx);
            let annotatedSlicedLyric = lyrics.slice(annotation.start_idx, annotation.end_idx)
            allFormattedLyrics.push(
                <span key={uniqueKey++}
                    className='unannotated-lyric'
                >
                    {unannotatedSlicedLyric}
                </span>
            );
            allFormattedLyrics.push(
                <span key={uniqueKey++}
                    className='highlighted-annotated-lyric'
                    ref={ node => { this.node = node; } }
                    onClick={() =>
                        {   this.setCurrentAnnotationId(annotation.id)
                        }}
                >
                    {annotatedSlicedLyric}
                </span>
            );

            if ((i === Object.keys(annotationsArr).length - 1)) {
                allFormattedLyrics.push(
                    <span key={uniqueKey++}
                        className='unannotated-lyric'
                    >
                        {lyrics.slice(annotation.end_idx, lyrics.length)}
                    </span>
                )
            }
            prevIdx = annotation.end_idx;
        };

```

### User authentication

### Signed-in users can create, update, and delete their own lyric annotations

</div>

* Annotations are saved to individual tracks and dynamically fetched from the database


### Signed-in users can leave or delete their own comments on individual tracks

### Signed-in users can upvote or downvote a annotation or a comment

* I utilized polymophic rails associations to leverage the ability to reuse the vote model for both annotations and comments. On top of allowing for DRY-er code for the current application, this choice will come in handy in a future implementation of leaving upvotable and downvotable comments on individual annotations.

```Ruby
    class Vote < ApplicationRecord
        validates :author_id, uniqueness: { scope: [:votable_id, :votable_type] }
        validates :value, :inclusion => -1..1

        belongs_to :votable, polymorphic: true

        belongs_to :user,
            foreign_key: :author_id,
            class_name: :User
    end

    def create
        @vote = Vote.new(vote_params)
        @vote.author_id = current_user.id
        if @vote.save!
            if @vote.votable_type == 'Annotation'
                @annotation = Annotation.find(@vote.votable_id)
                render 'api/annotations/show'
            elsif @vote.votable_type == 'Comment'
                @comment = Comment.find(@vote.votable_id)
                render 'api/comments/show'
            end
        else
            render json: @vote.errors.full_messages, status: 422
        end
    end
```
